       "3. Playing to People's Fantasies (Law 32): Being less accessible can add an element of allure and intrigue, making people want to know more about you and potentially fueling their fantasies.\n",
       "4. Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew (Law 33): Understanding someone's weaknesses or insecurities can give you leverage in a relationship or interaction. By being less accessible, you may be able to use this knowledge to your advantage while maintaining a sense of mystery.\n",
       "5. Be Royal in Your Own Fashion (Law 34): Exuding confidence and an air of exclusivity can help you command respect and be treated like a king or queen. Being less accessible can contribute to this image.</b>"
